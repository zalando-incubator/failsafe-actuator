# Failsafe actuator

This project provides a simple monitoring interface for spring boot applications which are using the [failsafe](https://github.com/jhalterman/failsafe) library. 
By using this library, the state of your [Circuit Breakers](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html) (open/closed) will be exposed to your spring applications endpoint.

Having the possibility to monitor the state of a Circuit Breakers is essential for live applications, since you can directly see if one the third parties
your app is relying on, currently is unavailable.

## Dependencies:

* Java 8
* Any build tool using Maven Central, or direct Download
* [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Auto Configuration
* Usage of [failsafe](https://github.com/jhalterman/failsafe)

## How to use:

In order to use this endpoint, just add the following dependency to your project:


**Gradle:**
```
compile("org.zalando:failsafe-actuator:0.2.0")
```

**Maven:**
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>failsafe-actuator</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

After you did this, Autowire the `CircuitBreakerFactory` to your Bean and call the method `createCircuitBreaker` in order to create a new **Circuit Breaker**.

Example:

```

@Component
public class MyBean {
    
        @Autowired
        private CircuitBreakerFactory factory;
        
        @Postconstruct
        public void init() {
            //The created Circuit breaker is automatically registered at the endpoint with the given name
            CircuitBreaker breaker = factory.createCircuitBreaker("SpringBreak");
        }
}
```

The [endpoint](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html) is reachable via _**http://${yourAddress}/failsafe**_.

The generated output will look like the following:

```
CircuitBreakerState{name='testBreaker1', isClosed=true}
CircuitBreakerState{name='testBreaker2', isClosed=false}
```

## How to build:

```
gradle build
```
